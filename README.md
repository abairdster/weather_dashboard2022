##### <center>*Description*</center>

A jQuery dyanmic web app that allows you to search the current weather and multiple data points such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index, as well as a 5 day forecast.
A vanilla css stylesheet, and the jQuery file weather.js


### <center>*Getting Started*</center>

Creating CSS with stylesheet made me think about the layout of the page when designing it.
jQuery allows for rapid development of your web application and simplifies what usually would take much more work using vanilla JS.
