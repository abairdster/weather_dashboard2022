# weather_dashboard2022

## This repo contains:
## This README
A jQuery dyanmic web app that allows you to search the current weather and multiple data points such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index, as well as a 5 day forecast.
A vanilla css stylesheet, and the jQuery file weather.js
## What I Learned:
Creating CSS with stylesheet made me think about the layout of the page when designing it.
jQuery allows for rapid development of your web application and simplifies what usually would take much more work using vanilla JS.
Breaking down any re-usable code into a function makes it easier to read and easier to code.
## Conclusion:
I need to keep improving my javascript scope knowledge as well as looking into JS best practices for improving my code. I had a lot of help, with my tutor. I have learned an extensive amount. I definitely need to learn more. I have used a few different referrences to try and understand/ communicate my strings. Wish I was more proficient.
